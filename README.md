# Tasker
Task Management application to keep track of projects users work on

This is my first project ever coding.
What I want to get out of this project is learning to code with consistency, use good design patterns, and expand my Java knowledge. 
Along the way the code may get jumbled, be bloated, or be done in a manner that could be expanded upon. The intent is to track this
and learn from it.

This project will be used in conjuction with a Raspberry Pi to send/recieve data from the client application.

Language: Java
Toolkit/Platform: JavaFX 8
IDE: Netbeans
